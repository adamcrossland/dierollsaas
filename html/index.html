<h1>DieRolSaaS</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
DieRolSaaS is a service that provides randomly-generated numbers. The numbers
to be generated are specified in a format common to fantasy role-playing
games: d6, 2d6, 1d4+1, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, <span class="highlight">d</span> is followed by a number that
nominally represents the number
of sides on the die to be rolled; d6 would be a familiar, six-sided cube. While
fantasy role-playing games commonly use d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20, this 
service will allow dice to have any number of sides. While a d31 would make for
a very strangely-shaped die, DieRolSaaS is perfectly happy to roll one for you.
</p>
<p>
The optional number that precedes the <span class="highlight">d</span>
(like 2d6) tells the number of dice to throw. A roll of 2d6 means two
six-sided dice.
</p>
<p>
The number that results from adding together the values of all of the rolled
dice can be modified up or down by any number by appending a plus or minus.
For example, 2d8+1 means roll two eight-sided dice, add the two numbers together
and add one, resulting in a value between 3 and 17. Or, you might want 2d4-1
which means roll two four-sided dice and
subtract one, giving a range of values from 1 to 7.
</p>
<p>
A novel addition to the classic format is the times specifier. To request that
the given set of rolls be performed repeatedly, simply append an
<span class="highlight">x</span> followed
by the number of times. For example: 3d6x6 would roll 3d6 6 times.

<h2>HOWTO</h2>
<p>To make a roll, just make a <span class="highlight">GET</span> request to
<pre>http://rolldice.adamcrossland.net/roll/spec</pre> or 
<pre>http://dierolsaas.appspot.com/roll/spec</pre>
where <span class="highlight">spec</span> is the die roll that you want, like this:
<pre>
http://rolldice.adamcrossland.net/roll/2d6+1x10
</pre>
<p>
The rolls are returned in a simple
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.json.org/'>JSON</a> format. Here is a
sample return for a roll of 2d6+1x10:

<pre>
\{"count":10,
	"rolls":[
		{"total":7,"count":2,"dice":[4,2]},
		{"total":7,"count":2,"dice":[4,2]},
		{"total":4,"count":2,"dice":[1,2]},
		{"total":8,"count":2,"dice":[2,5]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dice":[1,3]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dice":[2,2]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dice":[2,2]},
		{"total":9,"count":2,"dice":[2,6]},
		{"total":11,"count":2,"dice":[4,6]},
		{"total":9,"count":2,"dice":[4,4]}
	]
}
</pre>
