<h1>DieRolSaaS</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
DieRolSaaS is a service that provides randomly-generated numbers. The numbers
to be generated are specified in a format common to fantasy role-playing
games: d6, 2d6, 1d4+1, etc.
</p>
<p>
A novel addition to the classic format is the times specifier. To request that
the given set of die rolls be reformed repeatedly, simply append an 'x' followed
by the number of times to perform the rolls. For example: 3d6x6 would roll 3d6
6 times.
</p>
<h2>HOWTO</h2>
<p>To make a roll, just make a GET request to http://dierolsaas.adamcrossland.net/roll/spec 
where spec is the die roll that you want, like this:
<pre>
http://dierolsaas.adamcrossland.net/roll/2d6+1x10
</pre>
<p>
The rolls are returned in a simple JSON format. Here is a sample return for a
roll of 2d6+1x10:

<pre>
\{"count":10,
	"rolls":[
		{"total":7,"count":2,"dies":[4,2]},
		{"total":7,"count":2,"dies":[4,2]},
		{"total":4,"count":2,"dies":[1,2]},
		{"total":8,"count":2,"dies":[2,5]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dies":[1,3]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dies":[2,2]},
		{"total":5,"count":2,"dies":[2,2]},
		{"total":9,"count":2,"dies":[2,6]},
		{"total":11,"count":2,"dies":[4,6]},
		{"total":9,"count":2,"dies":[4,4]}
	]
}
